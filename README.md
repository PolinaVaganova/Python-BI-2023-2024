This repository houses scripts that were developed as homework assignments for the Bioinformatics Institute Python
course.

## Overview

The scripts in this repository cover a wide range of topics, including Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), API
integration, internet communication, telegram bot developing and parallel programming. Each script is accompanied by
documentation, usage examples and test cases to ensure its functionality and reliability.

## Content

1. `pybioseq_utils.py` - A library for processing protein and nucleic acid sequences, along with filtering FASTAQ files.
2. `bio_files_processor.py` - A library for reading and processing FASTA files.
3. `Showcases.ipynb` - Jupyter Notebook containing examples demonstrating features from the `pybioseq_utils` and
   `bio_files_processor` libraries.
4. `test_pybioseq_utils.py` - Script for testing the `pybioseq_utils` and `bio_files_processor` libraries using the
   `pytest` module.
5. `custom_random_forest.py` - Implementation of a custom random forest classifier for machine learning, with support
   for parallel programming.
6. `example_data` - Directory containing an example FASTA file.
